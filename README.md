whitelabel - A clean journey planner interface
==============================================

In our quest for building fast journey planners we realised that a clean webinterface, accessible by anyone, is a must have.
The interface is designed in such way a screenreader, mobile phone or desktop browser should have the same user experience.

This project builds on top of several foundations:
 - jQuery
 - a geocoder infrastructure (GeoJSON)
 - a journey planner (OpenTripPlannerJSON)
